    "text": "Two weeks before their final English exam, a group of students reviewed their plan. At first, they spent hours rereading notes and arguing over answers, but it was not effective. They switched to a simple routine: set a 25-minute timer, focus on one skill, then take a short break. Each evening they shadowed one listening track, summarized a short reading in four sentences, and wrote a 6–8 sentence paragraph. They also tracked errors in a shared log and adjusted the plan when needed. After ten days, their confidence improved and their practice scores increased steadily."
