    "text": "Lina joined a small startup as an intern for six weeks. At first, she planned to learn basic design only, but the manager encouraged her to try new tasks. She was in charge of updating the website and collecting customer feedback. The team might launch a new product next term, so Lina created a short survey and analyzed the results. By the end of the internship, she had learned to prioritize tasks, write clear emails, and present data to the team. These small achievements made her more confident and changed her career plan."
